## 📄 Overview
This project analyzes transactional sales data from a fictional retail Superstore to identify drivers of profitability and sales performance. The dataset spans **January 2020 to October 2023**, covering consumer, corporate, and home office segments.

The goal of this analysis was to move beyond raw numbers and provide actionable insights into:
* **Profitability:** Which categories and regions yield the highest margins?
* **Operational Risk:** Identifying volatile sales regions using statistical dispersion.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Understanding buying behaviors across different client types.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
* **Microsoft Excel:** Advanced Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Statistical Functions.
* **Data Analysis:** Time-series forecasting, Outlier detection, KPI calculation.
* **Statistical Metrics:** Correlation analysis, Standard Deviation, Variance.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Findings
* **Total Profitability:** The analysis revealed a total net profit of **$19,235.94** across the documented period.
* **Top Performer:** The **Technology** category emerged as the primary driver of revenue and profit.
* **Data Quality:** Identified and corrected inconsistencies in source data (e.g., mislabeled 'Progit Margin' columns) to ensure 100% calculation accuracy.
* **Risk Assessment:** Utilized Standard Deviation and Variance to highlight regions with unstable sales patterns requiring operational review.

## 📂 Data Dictionary
The dataset (`Cleaned_Superstore.xlsx`) has been enriched with the following metrics:

### 1. Transaction Information
* **Order ID/Date:** Unique identifiers and timestamps.
* **Segment:** Consumer, Corporate, Home Office.
* **Region:** Central, East, South, West.
* **Category:** Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology.

### 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* **Profit Margin:** Calculated as `Profit / Sales`. Represents the efficiency of each transaction.
* **Sales & Quantity:** Total revenue and units sold.
* **Discount:** Percentage deduction applied.

### 3. Statistical Enhancements
To provide immediate context for the distribution of sales data, the following columns were calculated:
* **Central Tendency:** Average Sales, Median Sales.
* **Dispersion:** Standard Deviation, Variance, Range (Max-Min).
* **Correlation Check:** Computed metric to identify relationships between variables.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Process
Raw data often contains errors. The following steps were taken to prepare the dataset for analysis:
1.  **Date Extraction:** Separated `Order Date` into distinct Year and Month columns for granular time-series analysis.
2.  **Metric Calculation:** Created a `Profit Margin` column to measure order efficiency.
3.  **Statistical Aggregation:** Calculated Mean, Median, and Variance to spot outliers and understand data spread.
4.  **Format Standardization:** Corrected column headers (e.g., fixed 'Progit Margin') and standardized currency/percentage formats.

## 🚀 Potential Use Cases
* **Profitability Analysis:** Determining high-margin products.
* **Forecasting:** Using 2020–2023 trends to predict 2024 performance.
* **Outlier Detection:** Spotting unusual order sizes using Standard Deviation.
